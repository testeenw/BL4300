Hello there, these are the directions for how to fold a paper airplane

Fold the paper in half hot-dog style. This should leave a long thin piece of paper. 
Now unfold the paper.
Fold the top outside corners (about 1/3 of the paper) towards the line formed by the hot-dog style folding. 
Now fold the newly created corner inwards toward the center line.
Hot-dog style fold the paper again along the initial fold line, with the folded flaps facing inside.
The plane should be mostly triangular, one side at a time, start at the pointed end and align the top and bottom of the paper. The top piece should stick out a bit. Repeat on the other side
